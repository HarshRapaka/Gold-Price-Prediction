# Gold Price Prediction

Predict future gold prices using machine learning models such as **Lasso Regression** and **Random Forest**. This project leverages financial indicators like SPX (S&P 500), SLV (Silver), and crude oil prices to forecast gold price trends.

## Project Overview

This repository presents a machine learning pipeline to:

- Analyze historical data affecting gold prices.
- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Train and evaluate regression models.
- Compare model performances using evaluation metrics.

## Dataset

The dataset includes:

- Gold prices
- S&P 500 index values (SPX)
- Silver prices (SLV)
- Crude oil prices (Oil)
